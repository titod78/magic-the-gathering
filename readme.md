# <a id="React_Native_0"></a>Simple React Native UI for listing Magic The Gathering cards.

- Simple app that basically lists all the cards of Magic The Gathering and displays some information
- The project has been created with [Expo](https://expo.io). Expo is an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React
- Magic The Gathering provides an awesome API for fetching the [data](https://docs.magicthegathering.io/)
- The app has been checked on android device

For this project, I have used Expo to crete an architecture based on components made with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
I have used [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) instead of classes in order to have a more scalable code.
I have used [Jest](https://jestjs.io) for unit testing of the components.

### <a id="Installation_29"></a>Installation

Get started with [Node](https://nodejs.org/) to use everything in the JS ecosystem, including Expo and React Native. It's recommend using the latest Node version to run.

You will run Expo locally to package, serve, and publish your projects

```
$ cd magic-the-gathering
$ npm install expo-cli --global
```

Install the dependencies and devDependencies

```
$ npm install
```

Run the server

```
$ npm run android
```

If you want to run the tests

```
$ npm run test
```

## [Mobile app: Expo client for iOS and Android](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v35.0.0/get-started/installation/#2-mobile-app-expo-client-for-ios)

Expo client is the tool you will use to run your projects while you're developing them. When you serve your project with Expo CLI, it generates a development URL that you can open in Expo client to preview your app
